# Decentralized Job portal

The application acts as one stop portal for Recruiters to post the jobs, Job seekers to apply for jobs. The user (Recruiter, Job seeker) details and job details 
are stored in ethereum blockchain. Recruiter can post the jobs and can view the applicants for the job with the public address(metamask account) of the applicants.
When clicked on the public address of the applicant, only the specific applicant details will be displayed. So that user can own his data without sharing any of his personal details.The job seeker can view, filter all the jobs and apply for the jobs.
